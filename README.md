# ContourPlot
Heat maps or contour plots are generally used to visualize topographical information.  They can be generated using a variety of R functions, each with its own conventions and strengths.  Here, heat maps with level curves (also referred to as contour lines) are generated using the filled.contour() function from the base R package grDevices.  One tricky aspect of this procedure is ensuring a uniform scale across separate images.
